##### Note 1)
As part of lesson 1 a zip file of pictures is supplied: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/prank.zip

##### Note 2)
One of the videos titled "*[Opening a File](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8CjSt624pc&list=PLBxMIgvbjWQi2B3cyOopGJJntd9NDC3iX&index=21)*" mentions to prefix the input string path variable with the letter **`r`** and it means "*raw path*" and it instructs python to take the string as it is and not to interpret it any other way. Example:

> `os.listdir("C:\OOP\prank")`
Compared to
> `os.listdir(r"C:\OOP\prank")`

 What's to be noted is [***String Literals***](https://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals), after researching some it my belief that it means ***raw string*** not path, as it is used to interpret a path in context but in isolation it is handling a string.

##### Note 3)
Also worth noting is [os.pathsep](https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.pathsep)
and [os.sep](https://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.sep)
